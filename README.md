# 100DaysOfCode
My #100DaysOfCode journey to learning JavaScript (again).

Day 1 - of #100daysofCode begins with a JavaScript syntax refresh, two small programs that output messages based on the time of day with Skillcrush course 102 and reading the introduction to Eloquent JavaScript.

Day 2 -  of #100DaysOfCode consists of a refresh of objects, methods, parameters, two small programs that call a method and chapter 1 of EloquentJavaScript.

Day 3 - of #100DaysOfCode consists of a finishing the Magic 8 Ball code.

Day 4 - of #100DaysOfCode I took a bit of a detour and worked my way through #freeCodeCamp Flexbox lessons and then re-coded a project that relied on floats using Flexbox. 

Day 5 - of #100DaysOfCode, started with coffee (of course) and a few small programs written with for, while loops and arrays. Now on to the DOM and reading more Eloquent JavaScript! I finished the lolclock project with DOM manipulation. 

Day 6 - of #100DaysOfCode, I worked on my portfolio using some CSS animations and transitions and worked on learning some jQuery. 

Day 7 - of #100DaysOfCode plan to work through more Free Code Camp JavaScript exercises and read and work through some of the exercises in Kyle Simpson's You Don't Know JS: Up & Going. Working on reinforcement and repetition. Began working on a small to do list.

Day8 - of #100DaysOfCode worked on the hope the small to do list in JavaScript I started on Day 7. Still reading Eloquent JavaScript.

Day 9 - of #100DaysOfCode continued working on the small to do list in JavasSript I started on Day 7 with Gordon Zhu Practical JavaScript course. This version of the app has a user interface.

Day 10 - of #100DaysOfCode I finished version 9 of my JavaScript to do list app completed. 

Day 11 - of #100DaysOfCode I finished the To Do List app. I plan to revisit and design a more user friendly UI.

Day 12 - of #100DaysOfCode I've focused on my new design for my portfolio built in Bootstrap 4 coding it from a Photoshop design comp I created. 

Day 13 - of #100DaysOfCode I got my new portfolio up and live. I need to work on some of the media queries. I included a jQuery transition on my navigation bar and some CSS3 animations.


Day 14 - #100DaysOfCode was more practice with JavaScript exercises.

Day 15 - #100DaysOfCode continuing with JavaScript exercises and Eloquent Javascript. I also worked on a new design comp in Photoshop (not technically coding but hey, I did it). Enjoying the journey.

Day 16 of #100DaysOfCode - I refactored the Magic 8 Ball code with some jQuery (which isn't "cool" anymore???). It now has a user interface thanks to Skillcrush that includes a onClick event and prompt for a user question input.

Day 17 - #100DaysOfCode I'm starting the Complete JavaScript Course 2018 on Udemy. Working from books doesn't seem to be the way I learn best and I'm finding I don't know what to do with what I've learned past basic #javascript syntax. So, I'm going to try this course.  

Day 18  - #100DaysOfCode, began section two of Complete JavaScript Course.  

Day 19 - #100DaysOfCode, I completed the Basic JavaScript section on Free Code Camp!!!

Day 20 - #100DaysofCode, I plan to finish section 2 of the Complete JavaScript Course on Udemy. It's really helping me.  

Days 21 - #100DaysOfCode, still working on section 2 of the Complete JavaScript Course on Udemy. 

Day 22 - #100DaysofCode, I understand objects and methods much better now. Wrapping up loops and iterations. Started using Codeanywhere so I can work during my lunch break. 

Days 23, 24 & 25 - #100DayOfCode I finished section 2 of the Complete JavaScript Course on Udemy. 

Day 26 - #100DaysOfCode, I worked through section 3 of the Complete JavaScript Course on Udemy (execution stack, scope chain, and the this keyword). Also applied for the #freeCodeCamp JAMstack Hackathon.

Day 27 & 28 - #100DaysOfCode, I coded up the HTML, CSS, and media queries structure for my new portfolio ( I wasn't happy with the previous one).

Day 29 - #100DaysOfCode, started section 4 of the Complete JavaScript Course. 

Day 30 - #100DaysOfCode, continued to work on coding a dice rolling game project with Complete JavaScript Course and finish up media queries for my portfolio redesign. 

Day 31 - #100DaysOfCode, debugged code from dice rolling game (pig game) and portfolio media queries. 

Day 32 - #100DaysOfCode, finally got the portfolio website up: http://www.preciousmack.com. It is still a work in progress but, overall I'm happy with this iteration. I have a working #php form, CSS transitions, and a sticky nav built with JavaScript.

Day 33 - #100DaysOfcode, I finished the Pig Game tutorial with @jonasschmedtman Complete JavaScript Course. This really is a great course and I feel like I'm learning a lot and picking up some serious problem solving skills.

Day 34 - #100DaysOfCode, I added normalize.css to my portfolio site to fix some cross browser issues and worked through some ES6 JavaScript tutorials on Free Code Camp and Codecademy. 

Day 35 - #100DaysOfCode recap, began an awesome full stack project generously created by @stephenmf. Already learning a lot and looking forward to completing more assignments.
