# 100DaysOfCode
My #100DaysOfCode journey to learning JavaScript (again).

Day 1 - of #100daysofCode begins with a JavaScript syntax refresh, two small programs that output messages based on the time of day with Skillcrush course 102 and reading the introduction to Eloquent JavaScript.

Day 2 - #100DaysOfCode consists of a refresh of objects, methods, parameters, two small programs that call a method and chapter 1 of EloquentJavaScript.

Day 3 - #100DaysOfCode consists of a finishing the Magic 8 Ball code.

Day 4 - #100DaysOfCode I took a bit of a detour and worked my way through #freeCodeCamp Flexbox lessons and then re-coded a project that relied on floats using Flexbox. 

Day 5 - #100DaysOfCode, started with coffee (of course) and a few small programs written with for, while loops and arrays. Now on to the DOM and reading more Eloquent JavaScript!
