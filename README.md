My #100DaysOfCode journey to learning JavaScript (again).

Day 1 - of #100daysofCode begins with a JavaScript syntax refresh, two small programs that output messages based on the time of day with Skillcrush course 102 and reading the introduction to Eloquent JavaScript.

Day 2 -  of #100DaysOfCode consists of a refresh of objects, methods, parameters, two small programs that call a method and chapter 1 of EloquentJavaScript.

Day 3 - of #100DaysOfCode consists of a finishing the Magic 8 Ball code.

Day 4 - of #100DaysOfCode I took a bit of a detour and worked my way through #freeCodeCamp Flexbox lessons and then re-coded a project that relied on floats using Flexbox. 

Day 5 - of #100DaysOfCode, started with coffee (of course) and a few small programs written with for, while loops and arrays. Now on to the DOM and reading more Eloquent JavaScript! I finished the lolclock project with DOM manipulation. 

Day 6 - of #100DaysOfCode, I worked on my portfolio using some CSS animations and transitions and worked on learning some jQuery. 

Day 7 - of #100DaysOfCode plan to work through more Free Code Camp JavaScript exercises and read and work through some of the exercises in Kyle Simpson's You Don't Know JS: Up & Going. Working on reinforcement and repetition. Began working on a small to do list.
